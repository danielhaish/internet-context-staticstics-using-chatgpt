Note:
While this project utilizes the capabilities of a language model like OpenAI's ChatGPT, it is not considered a reliable tool for monitoring internet activity.

The purpose of this program is not to spy on individuals, but to gather statistics for organizations with their consent.

Usage:
This project can be used by researchers to study internet usage patterns and help organizations improve their online content. Additionally, it can assist parents in monitoring and understanding their children's internet activity.

Future Development:

Notify parents via email if viewed content is deemed "unsafe."
Present collected data in a visually appealing manner using graphs and time-series analysis.
Enable easy addition of new content subjects.
Add the ability to incorporate tokens for API access.
